# JContinua
plot V-M-fi-u diagrams of straight beams with discontinuities

JContinua was programed with an educational use in mind. Basically, it plots 
the complete set of diagrams for a straight beam: shear forces, bending moments,
flexure angles, & transversal displacements. Also normal forces if applicable.
Diagrams are annotated with relevant values.
The beam may have a whole set of discontinuities in both loads an connections. 
The beam can be divided into up to eight sections, thus allowing to seven 
discontinuities.
Diagrams can be exported for future use.
